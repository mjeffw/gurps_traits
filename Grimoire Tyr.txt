Grimoire of Týr (ᛏ)
Mind Spells
  As a reminder, any spell with a duration of Indefinite has a base duration of 3 minutes, which may be extended for an additional 3 minutes per FP spent (no roll necessary), unless otherwise noted. The runecaster doesn’t have to decide up front how long to extend the spell, they can wait until the spell is about to end and then extend it for another three minutes. This can be continued indefinitely until the caster allows the spell to end normally, he loses consciousness, or runs out of FP.
  To make it easier to optimize some spells either to lower the cost or increase its efficacy, this version introduces Variable spells. 
  Variable spells allow the player to either buy a bare-bones version of the spell for a relatively low point cost, or to modify the base version of the spell to make it more powerful and therefore cost more. Options are listed below the spell and marked with the ♣ symbol.
  In addition, some spells have been rewritten to have a “Self” version, which only affects the caster, in addition to the normal version that can be cast on others.
  Any spell variation, whether it is moving from a “Self” version to being castable on others, or adding variations or levels, can be bought by paying the difference between the version currently possessed and the one desired.
  And as always, the runecaster is NOT limited to the spells in this Grimoire. Any spell that they can imagine that involves earth and metal, or interdimensional gates, can be created with this system. Use the existing spells as guidelines. For example, Blink could be cast on a person other than the caster for additional cost. Collaborate with the GM to create new spells.
  
  
Berserker
Keywords: Resisted (Will).
Rune/Effect: Tyr/Mind [4] + Control (−1).
Full Cost: 30 points.
Casting Roll: Will.
Range: Unlimited.
Duration: 3 minutes.
  The victim gains the Berserk disadvantage (Adventurers, p.57) for the duration of this spell. He goes berserk in any combat situation, regardless of whether he was wounded or not.
  Statistics: Affliction 1 (Will; Based on Will, +20%; Disadvantage, Berserk, +10%; Fixed Duration, +0%; Malediction 2, +150%; No Signature, +20%; Runecasting, −30%) [30]. 
Bravery
Keywords: Buff.
Rune/Effect: Tyr/Mind [4] + Strengthen (+1).
Full Cost: 18 points.
Casting Roll: Innate Attack (Gaze) to aim. 
Range: 100 yards. 
Duration: 3 minutes.
  You make the subject braver. The subject adds 4 levels to his Will whenever he makes a Fright Check or must resist the Intimidation skill (Adventurers, p.79) or a supernatural power that induces fear. He also subtracts 1 from all Intimidation rolls made against him. However, this bravery makes the subject overconfident. Treat this as having Overconfidence (Adventurers, p.64) with a self-control number of 12.
  Statistics: Affliction (Advantage, Bravery, +70%; Fixed Duration, +0%; Increased 1/2D, 10x, +15%; No Signature, +20%; Runecasting, −30%) [18]. 
  “Bravery” is Fearlessness 4 (Magical, −10%; Temporary Disadvantage, Overconfidence (12), −5%) [7].
Calm Emotions
Keywords: Resisted (Will).
Rune/Effect: Tyr/Mind [4] + Strengthen (+1).
Full Cost: 25 points.
Casting Roll: Will. 
Range: Unlimited. 
Duration: 3 minutes.
  You can calm down a single creature. Only creatures with a racial IQ 6+ or less can be affected. This spell stops Berserk and prevents the subject from doing any destructive actions (he can still defend himself). Should the creature be attacked or injured, the compulsion breaks.
  Statistics: Mind Control (Accessibility, IQ 6+ creatures only, −10%; Accessibility, Only to calm down, −30%; Emotion Control, −50%; Independent, +70%; Runecasting, −30%) [25].
Command
Keywords: Resisted (Will).
Rune/Effect: Tyr/Mind [4] + Control (−1).
Full Cost: 20 points.
Casting Roll: Quick Contest of Will vs. Will. 
Range: Unlimited. 
Duration: 1 second.
  Give a subject one immediate command – a word and a gesture, or at most two words – which the subject must obey. If the subject is unable to fulfill the command immediately or on his next turn, the spell has no effect. You must be able to see or touch the subject and the command must be spoken in a language the subject understands to cast this spell. To use this ability, concentrate for one second and then roll a Quick Contest: your Will vs. your subject’s Will, applying the range penalties from the Speed and Size/Range Table.
  Examples:
  “Drop it!” – the subject drops whatever he was holding.
  “Look!” – the subject looks in the direction the caster indicates.
  “Wait!” – the subject takes the Wait maneuver on his next turn.
  If you win, your charmed subject will obey your command. If you attempt to force the subject to act against its principles (e.g., commit suicide or harm a loved one), roll another Quick Contest. If the subject wins, the spell has no effect.
  If you lose, you cannot attempt to control that subject again for 24 hours, and he feels a sense of mental coercion emanating from you.
  Statistics: Mind Control (Accessibility, At most two words, −20%; Accessibility, Must be able to understand command, −20%; Fixed Duration, +0%; Independent, +70%; Reduced Duration, 1/180, −40%; Runecasting, −30%; Sense-based, Hearing, −20%) [20].

Full Cost: 14 points for basic, 34 for improved.
Casting Roll: Will. 
Range: Unlimited. 
Duration: Instantaneous.
  By taking a Concentrate maneuver and making a Will roll (adjusted by the range to any possible subjects), you can detect the direction and general number of IQ 1+ beings in your vicinity. If any are detected, you can make an IQ roll to get more details. On a critical success, the GM tells you most if not all of the details of what you could detect.
  The Improved version gives you the details of a critical success on any success.
  Statistics: Detect (Minds; Runecasting, −30%) [14].
  Improved version adds Precise (+100%) [34].

Keywords: Resisted (Will).
Rune/Effect: Tyr/Mind [4] + Strengthen (+1).
Full Cost: 3 points.
Casting Roll: Quick Contest of Will vs. Will. 
Range: Self. 
Duration: 3 minutes.
  The caster can radiate an aura of fear. Everyone he wishes to affect resists with Will, at a bonus based on their distance from the caster (use the Size and Speed/Range Table). If a subject resists, the caster has his attention, but he reacts normally. Those the caster chooses not to affect see nothing special about the caster.
  Anyone who fails rolls on the Reaction Table with a +3 bonus – or the caster can add +3 to an Influence Roll against that person. All other modifiers, such as situational modifiers, apply. This bonus can be used only in situations where threats are effective (such as potential combat situations). In other situations, it may even provide a −3 penalty!
  Statistics: Charisma 3 (Accessibility, Only in situations where threats are effective, −35%; Accessibility, Only influences via fear – Fearlessness resists, −20%; Nuisance Effect, May provide a penalty in inappropriate situations, −15%; Requires Will vs. Will Roll, −15%; Selective Area, +20%; Short-Range 2, −20%; Runecasting, −30%) [3].
Forgetfulness
Keywords: Resisted (Will).
Rune/Effect: Tyr/Mind [4] + Destroy (−1).
Full Cost: 29 points for basic, 40 for improved.
Casting Roll: None. 
Range: Unlimited. 
Duration: 30 minutes or permanent.

Loyalty
Keywords: Resisted (Will).
Rune/Effect: Tyr/Mind [4] + Control (−1).
Full Cost: 36 points.
Casting Roll: Quick Contest of Will vs. Will. 
Range: Unlimited. 
Duration: 3 minutes.
  You can temporarily make the subject your loyal friend, giving him the Sense of Duty (Caster) disadvantage (see Adventurers, p.65). If the subject is willing, no resistance roll is needed. If not, he resists with Will and must be completely immobilized or otherwise under your control while you cast the spell. Successful casting gets you inside of his head. You must then win a second Quick Contest of Will vs. Will – or make another unopposed Will roll, for a willing subject. 
  Statistics: Mind Control (Accessibility, Only to add Sense of Duty, Caster, −50%; Accessibility, Subject must be immobilized or controlled, −20%; Conditioning Only, −50%; Fixed Duration, +0%; Runecasting, −30%) [10].

Keywords: Area (Leveled), Resisted (Will).
Full Cost: 41 points for level 1 + 5 points/additional level.
Casting Roll: Will.
Range: Unlimited.
Duration: 3 minutes.
  Creatures in the area are dazed for 3 minutes. If a subject is standing, he remains upright, but can do nothing. If the subject is struck, slapped, or shaken, he recovers on his next turn. After that the subject is stunned (Exploits, p.60) for 3 minutes and may roll vs. Will once per second to recover. You can omit any creatures from the effect.

Full Cost: 8 points.
Casting Roll: Will. 
Range: Unlimited. 
Duration: Instantaneous.

  Statistics: Toxic Attack 3d-1 (Accessibility, Only on living IQ 1+ beings, −10%; Damage cannot exceed margin of victory, −50%; Malediction 2, +150%; No Signature, +20%; Runecasting, −30%) [20].
