Grimoire of Ur ()
Weather Spells
  As a reminder, any spell with a duration of Indefinite has a base duration of 3 minutes, which may be extended for an additional 3 minutes per FP spent (no roll necessary), unless otherwise noted. The runecaster doesn’t have to decide up front how long to extend the spell, they can wait until the spell is about to end and then extend it for another three minutes. This can be continued indefinitely until the caster allows the spell to end normally, he loses consciousness, or runs out of FP.
  To make it easier to optimize some spells either to lower the cost or increase its efficacy, this version introduces Variable spells. 
  Variable spells allow the player to either buy a bare-bones version of the spell for a relatively low point cost, or to modify the base version of the spell to make it more powerful and therefore cost more. Options are listed below the spell and marked with the o symbol.
  In addition, some spells have been rewritten to have a “Self” version, which only affects the caster, in addition to the normal version that can be cast on others.
  Any spell variation, whether it is moving from a “Self” version to being castable on others, or adding variations or levels, can be bought by paying the difference between the version currently possessed and the one desired.
  And as always, the runecaster is NOT limited to the spells in this Grimoire. Any spell that they can imagine that involves earth and metal, or interdimensional gates, can be created with this system. Use the existing spells as guidelines. For example, Blink could be cast on a person other than the caster for additional cost. Collaborate with the GM to create new spells.
  
  
Air Jet 
Keywords: Jet, Obvious.
Rune/Effect: Úr/Weather [4] + Control (−1). 
Full Cost: 6 points/level.
Casting Roll: Innate Attack (Beam) to hit.
Range: 20 yards. 
Duration: Instantaneous. 
  Shoots a thin jet of air from one finger. A hit does 2d damage for knockback purposes only (Exploits, p. 53) – not actual injury – per energy point in the spell. Treat this as actual crushing damage to swarms or vaporous beings, however! 
  Statistics: Crushing Attack 1d (Blockable, −5%; Cosmic, Does knockback-based damage against diffuse targets, +50%; Double Knockback, +20%; In- creased 1/2D, 2×, +5%; Increased Range, 2×, +10%; Jet, +0%; No Blunt Trauma, −20%; No Wounding*, −25%; Runecasting, −30%) [6/level]. 
  * Except versus diffuse targets, an exception which halves the value of this limitation. 
Call Lightning 
Keywords: Missile, Obvious.
Rune/Effect: Úr/Weather [4] + Strengthen (+1). 
Full Cost: 10 points per level.
Casting Roll: Innate Attack (Gaze).
Range: 100 yards.
Duration: Instantaneous. 
  When you have storm clouds above your head, you can cause a lightning to strike your victim, dealing 1d burning surge damage per level. Metallic armor counts as DR 1 against this attack, but nonmetallic armor protects normally. Targets stuck by this attack must make an HT roll, at −1 per 2 points of penetrating damage, or be physically stunned. On subsequent turns, they can roll HT to recover. 
  This spell bypasses any cover that does not pro- vide overhead protection, and negates attack penal- ties to hit crouching, kneeling, sitting, or prone tar- gets. 
  Once used, the storm clouds need a minimum of 5 seconds to rebuild their electrical charge before the caster can call lightning again. 
  Statistics: Burning Attack 1d (Environmental, Storm, −40%; Nuisance Effect, Behaves erratically around conductors, −5%; Overhead, +30%; Runecasting, −30%; Surge, Arcing, +100%; Side Effect, Stunning, +50%; Takes Recharge, 5 seconds, −10%) [10/level]. 
Chain Lightning 
Keywords: Missile, Obvious.
Rune/Effect: Úr/Weather [4] + Create (−2). 
Full Cost: 15 points per level.
Casting Roll: Innate Attack (Beam).
Range: 100 yards.
Duration: Instantaneous. 
  You fire a coruscating discharge of electricity that does 1d burning surge damage per level. The dis- charge leaps to other available targets after hitting the initial target! If that attack succeeds, immediate- ly consult your margin of success. If the margin is high enough to hit a separate target after accounting for range penalties plus −2, the next target is struck unless they make an appropriate active defense. If the target is hit then check the margin again until the attack fails to hit or seven targets (the maximum) are hit. 
  Metallic armor counts as DR 1 against this attack, but nonmetallic armor protects normally. Targets stuck by this attack must make an HT roll, at −1 per 2 points of penetrating damage, or be physically stunned. On subsequent turns, they can roll HT to recover. Chain Lightning behaves unpredictably around conductors. 
  Statistics: Burning Attack 1d (Nuisance Effect, Behaves erratically around conductors, −5%; Rapid Fire, Chaining, 7 targets, +70%; Runecasting, −30%; Surge, Arcing, +100%; Side Effect, Stunning, +50%) [15/level]. 
Cool C
Keywords: Area (Leveled).
Rune/Effect: Úr/Weather [4] + Control (−1).
Full Cost: 6 for level 1 + 5 pts/additional level*. 
Casting Roll: None. 
Range: 100 yards. 
Duration: Indefinite. 
  This spell lowers the ambient temperature of the area. The basic version can reduce the temperature in a two-yard radius by up to 40°F. This occurs at a rate of 4° per level per second of concentration. This will never do damage directly, but see Cold (Ex- ploits, p. 70) for effects. 
  Statistics: Temperature Control 2 (Cold, −50%; In- creased Range, 10×, +30%; Runecasting, −30%; Var- iable, Area, +5%) [6]. 
  Additional levels add Area Effect (+50%) [+5]. 
* Cold as Blixen: For each additional 6 points, in- crease the maximum degrees of cooling by an- other 40°F. E.g., 12 points for 80°F, 18 points for 120°F. Each +40 also increases the cost of addi- tional levels by +5 (e.g., at 80°F, each additional level costs +10 points). (Increase Temperature Control level by +2 per multiple.) 
Fan 
Keywords: Jet, Obvious.
Rune/Effect: Ur/Weather [3] + Strengthen (+1). 
Full Cost: 1 point.
Casting Roll: Use Innate Attack (Beam) to hit. 
Range: 2 yards.
Duration: Instantaneous. 
  You can project a stream of air strong enough to scatter dust and extinguish candles at two yards. It has no combat effect. 
  Statistics: Perk (Create breeze; Runecasting, −30%) [1]. 
Frostbite 
Keywords: Resisted (HT).
Rune/Effect: Ur/Weather [3] + Strengthen (+1). 
Full Cost: 10 points/level.
Casting Roll: Use Innate Attack (Gaze) to aim. 
Range: Unlimited.
Duration: Instantaneous. 
  Lowers the temperature of the subject’s body, causing 1d cr (freezing*) injury per level to living beings and any entity that can freeze (e.g., water elementals) or needs warmth (creatures of fire qualify). Cast from a distance, it affects the whole victim; cast by touch, harm is limited to the part touched. Armor and DR don’t protect! 
  Use the range modifiers from the Size and Speed/Range table if cast from a distance. 
  Statistics: Crushing Attack (HT; Accessibility, Only living creatures or entities that can freeze or needs heat, −10%; No Blunt Trauma, −20%; No Knockback, −10%; Malediction 2, +150%; No Signature, +20%; Runecasting, −30%) [10/level]. 
  * Freezing attack is treated as if it were Crushing with the Accessibility, Only living creatures or enti- ties that can freeze/need heat, No Blunt Trauma, and No Knockback limitations. 
Frostburn F
Keywords: Missile, Obvious.
Rune/Effect: Úr/Weather [4] + Create (−2).
Full Cost: 7 points per level for 2 seconds. 
Casting Roll: Use Innate Attack (Projectile) to hit.
Range: 100 yards. 
Duration: Instantaneous. 
  This spell conjures an orb of frost, which will ad- here to and freeze any creature it strikes. Use Innate Attack (Projectile) to hit, applying normal range penalties. It does 1d−1 burning damage per level. This damage comes from extreme cold, not heat, so it cannot set anything on fire. The frost sticks to the target, damaging him again every second for a set number of seconds. The cycles can be stopped only by taking a point of burning damage from fire. 
  If your foe is within one yard of you, he may at- tempt to parry this attack (actually parrying your hand). If such a parry is successful, you must roll against DX to avoid hitting yourself with your own orb of frostburn! 
  Statistics: Burning Attack 1d−1 (Cyclic, 2 cycles, 1 second intervals, +100%; No Incendiary Effect, −10%; Nuisance Effect, Dangerous to be parried, −5%; Runecasting, −30%) [7]. 
* Keep on Keeping On: The cost of 2 seconds of damage is 7 points. Each +1 second is +4 points. (Increase Cyclic by +100% per additional se- cond.) 
Lightning Armor 
Keywords: Buff.
Rune/Effect: Úr/Weather [4] + Create (−2). 
Full Cost: 10 points.
Casting Roll: None.
Range: Self.
Duration: 3 minutes. 
  The caster is sheathed in crackling lightning that deals 1d−1 burning surge damage to enemies who touch his body or attack him with a conductive weapon. Metallic armor counts as DR 1 against this attack, but nonmetallic armor protects normally. Targets stuck by this attack must make an HT roll, at −1 per 2 points of penetrating damage, or be physically stunned. On subsequent turns, they can roll HT to recover. 
  Statistics: Burning Attack 1d−1 (Always On, −40%; Aura, +80%; Runecasting, −30%; Melee Attack, Reach C, −30%; Surge, Arcing, +100%; Side Effect, Stunning, +50%) [10]. 
Lightning Stare 
Keywords: Buff.
Rune/Effect: Úr/Weather [4] + Create (−2). 
Full Cost: 11 points/level.
Casting Roll: Innate Attack (Beam).
Range: 10 yards.
Duration: Instantaneous. 
  A 10-yard jet of lightning erupts from your eyes. Use Innate Attack (Beam) to hit. Don’t apply range penalties; treat this as a long melee weapon rather than a ranged attack. It does burning damage with dice equal to your level of this spell. Metallic armor counts as DR 1 against this attack, but non- metallic armor protects normally. Targets stuck by this attack must make an HT roll, at −1 per 2 points of penetrating damage, or be physically stunned. On subsequent turns, they can roll HT to recover. Lightning behaves unpredictably around conductors. 
  Statistics: Burning Attack 1d (Jet, +0%; Nuisance Effect, Behaves erratically around conductors, −5%; Runecasting, −30%; Surge, Arcing, +100%; Side Effect, Stunning, +50%) [11/level]. 
Lightning Weapon 
Keywords: Weapon Buff.
Rune/Effect: Ur/Weather [4] + Create (−2). 
Full Cost: 13 points.
Casting Roll: None.
Range: Touch.
Duration: Three minutes. 
  Once cast upon a weapon, this spell causes it to do an additional 1d of follow-up burning surge damage. The weapon must be at least partly metallic; weapons made entirely of wood and/or stone will not hold the spell. The weapon will visibly crackle with electricity. 
  Statistics: Affliction 1 (HT; Accessibility, Only on metallic weapons, −40%; Advantage, Lightning Weapon, +50%; Fixed Duration, +0%; Increased 1/2D, 10x, +15%; No Signature, +20%; Sorcery, −15%) [13]. 
  Notes: “Lightning Weapon” is Burning Attack 1d (Follow-Up, This weapon, +0%; Magical, −10%; Surge, +20%; Visible, −10%) [5]. 
Rinse 
Keywords: None.
Rune/Effect: Úr/Weather [4] + Control (−1). 
Full Cost: 1 point.
Casting Roll: None.
Range: Self.
Duration: Instantaneous. 
  You can moisten the exterior of your body, becoming damp enough to negate ongoing damage due to contact effects. You can extinguish flame if you’re on fire, flush away acid or poison, and so on. The spell pulls natural humidity from the air; if there is no humidity – in an extremely dry climate, for example – the spell simply doesn’t work. 
  Statistics: Perk (Rinse; Runecasting, −30%) [1]. 
Shocking Touch 
Keywords: Obvious.
Rune/Effect: Úr/Weather [4] + Create (−2).
Full Cost: 10 points/level.
Casting Roll: Use unarmed combat skill or DX to hit.
Range: Touch.
Duration: Instantaneous. 
  This spell charges the caster’s hand with electricity. The caster must touch the subject to trigger this spell. The touch deals 1d burning surge damage per level of this spell. Metallic armor counts as DR 1 against this attack, but nonmetallic armor protects normally. Targets stuck by this attack must make an HT roll, at −1 per 2 points of penetrating damage, or be physically stunned. On subsequent turns, they can roll HT to recover. 
  Statistics: Burning Attack 1d (Melee Attack, Reach C, Cannot Parry, −35%; Runecasting, −30%; Surge, Arcing, +100%; Side Effect, Stunning, +50%) [10/level]. 
Stroke of Lightning 
Keywords: Missile, Obvious.
Rune/Effect: Ur/Weather [4] + Create (−2). 
Full Cost: 10 points/level.
Casting Roll: Use Innate Attack (Beam) to aim. 
Range: 50 yards.
Duration: Instantaneous. 
  You fire a stream of electricity that does 1d burning damage per level. The spell strikes all targets in a 50-yard line. On a hit, the line is on target; otherwise, use the Scatter rule (see Exploits, p.45) to determine a new target point. Once you know the target point, trace a line between the caster and that point. 
  Targets stuck by this attack suffer 1d burning surge damage per level and must make an HT roll, at −1 per 2 points of penetrating damage, or be physically stunned. On subsequent turns, they can roll HT to recover. Lightning behaves unpredictably around conductors. This attack has the 1/2D range of 5 yards. 
  Statistics: Burning Attack 1d (Cone 1, +60%; Nuisance Effect, Behaves erratically around conductors, −5%; Reduced Range, 1/2x, −10%; Sorcery, −15%; Surge, +20%; Side Effect, Stunning, +50%) [10/level]. 
Wall of Wind 
Keywords: Obvious. 
Rune/Effect: Úr/Weather [4] + Control (−1).
Full Cost: 78 pts for level 1 + 10/additional level.
Casting Roll: Use Innate Attack (Gaze) to aim.
Range: 100 yards.
Duration: Five minutes. 
  This spell conjures a wall of wind. You do not have to concentrate to maintain it, Wall of Wind is “fire and forget.” It can be cast repeatedly, allowing the sorcerer to put up multiple walls as needed, but each wall dissipates once the duration runs out. 
  Wall of Wind 1 has a maximum area of six square yards, with each additional level doubling that cumulatively. For example, Wall of Wind 3 has a limit of 24 square yards, allowing the sorcerer to conjure a wall six yards long by four yards high, 12 yards long by two yards high, or any other valid combination. The caster may form this into any shape he wishes. 
  Low-tech missiles are buffeted off course as they cross the wall and suffer a −6 penalty to hit. High- tech bullets suffer a −2 penalty to hit. Any creature trying to cross the wall takes 4d knockback damage in a random direction. The wall also churns up loose ground material, such as dust, small leaves, insects, and twigs, if there are any in the area. Thus, any creatures crossing the wall must make a HT roll or be blinded for 3 seconds. Simply closing the eyes protects against this effect. 
  Statistics: Affliction 1 (HT; Area Effect, 2 yards, +50%; Disadvantage, Blindness, +50%; Environ- mental, Debris present, −20%; Extended Duration, 30x, +60%; Fixed Duration, +0%; Link, +10%; Persistent, +40%; Reduced Duration, 1/60, -35%; Runecasting, −30%; Variable, Area, +5%; Vision- Based, +150%; Wall, Shapeable, +60%) [44] + Crushing Attack 2d (Area Effect, 2 yards, +50%; Cosmic, Impedes Missile, +50%; Double Knockback, +20%; Extended Duration, 30x, +60%; Link, +10%; Magical, −10%; No Wounding, −50%; Persistent, +40%; Variable, Area, +5%; Wall, Shapeable, +60%) [34]. 
  Additional levels increase Area Effect (+50%) to both advantages [+10].
